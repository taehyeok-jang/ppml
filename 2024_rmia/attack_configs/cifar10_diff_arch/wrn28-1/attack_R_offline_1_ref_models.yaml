run: # Configurations for a specific run
  random_seed: 12345 # Integer number of specifying random seed
  log_dir: demo_cifar10_wrn28_1 # String for indicating where to save all the information, including computed signals. 
  time_log: True # Indicate whether to log the time for each step

audit: # Configurations for auditing
  privacy_game: privacy_loss_model # Indicate the privacy game from privacy_loss_model, privacy_loss_sample
  report_log: report_reference_1_ref_model # String that indicates the folder where we save the and auditing report.
  offline: True # Indicate whether to use the offline setting (only out models) or the online settings (both in and out models)
  num_ref_models: 2 # number of reference models can be between 1 and 254. Beware of putting the right data_dir in data to select the right set of models. (below)
  augmentation: none # Indicate whether to use augmentation for the query points
  nb_augmentation: 2 # number of queries used for the attack (should have been computed beforehand). When augmentation=none and nb_augmentation: 2, takes the original image
  signal: loss_reference # name of the signal used to perform the relative attack. Can be the parameter for other attacks
  target_idx: 0 # idx of the target model, can be int, "ten", "fifty", or "all" for an average over multiple models
  subset: all # subset on which the attack is performed, can be "all", "typical", "atypical", "not typical", "not atypical"
  allout: False # True only when reference's logits are performed on a separate dataset

data: # Configuration for input logits
  target_dir: scripts/exp/cifar10_wrn28_1 # directory where the set of target models are trained (logits should have already been computed)
  reference_dir: scripts/exp/cifar10_2_wrn28_1 # directory where the set of reference models are trained (can be identical to target_dir) (logits should have already been computed)
  dataset_size: 50000 # the size of the whole dataset for which we have computed the logits. (e.g. 50000, or 60000)
